# Security Policy

### Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability please use one of the methods listed below.

There are two ways of reaching us:

-   Signal (preferred): [Profile](https://signal.me/#eu/93TrwtK_NMh0LPYkCgvxjr8KavSsmWSgMsaCNQmuKtlAh_f3iFpEu7_ZogV5SreC)
-   Email: `reply@nove.team`, `matt@nove.team`

Please provide complete information about the bug, meaning: date and time of execution, affected endpoints, full description on how to reproduce it and what is the vulnerability.
We may ask additional questions.

Please refrain from sharing the bug with others unless explicitly allowed to. This gives us time to prepare a solution and prevents from abusing it by other people.
When patched, there is no danger. Meaning you are able to freely share it without worrying about releasing private information.
